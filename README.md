# Instructions to Run the Code

## 1. Ensure Dependencies are Installed
Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## 2. Prepare the Dataset Files
Ensure the following dataset files are in the same directory as the code:

parkinsons.csv
rice.csv
credit_approval.csv

## 3. Run the Driver Script
Execute the rf_driver.py script to train and evaluate the Random Forest Classifier.
Execute the main_driver_neural_network.py to train and evaluate Neural Network.

## 4. View Results
The script will print accuracy and F1 scores for each dataset and number of trees in the console.
Learning curve/Metric plots will be saved in the same directory (eg Digits_rf_metrics.png)
